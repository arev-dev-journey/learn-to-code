# Java Learning Journey

This directory contains my Java learning materials, organized into clear categories for efficient study and practice.

## 📁 Directory Structure

### 🧮 `leetcode/`
**Purpose**: Data Structures and Algorithms problems from LeetCode
- Contains solutions to coding challenges
- Focuses on problem-solving skills and algorithm implementation
- Files: `TwoSum.java`, `UniqueEmail.java`, `Solution.java`, etc.

### 📚 `tutorials/`
**Purpose**: Online course materials and tutorials
- Udemy courses and other online learning resources
- Structured learning content with organized sections
- Contains: `udemy/` with course materials like `JavaMasterclass2025/`

### 🏃‍♂️ `practice/`
**Purpose**: Personal practice and experimentation
- **`basics/`**: Fundamental Java concepts (variables, data types, etc.)
- **`exercises/`**: Practice exercises (loops, conditionals, etc.)
- **`experiments/`**: Code experiments and quick tests

### 🚀 `projects/`
**Purpose**: Complete Java applications and projects
- Substantial projects that demonstrate Java skills
- Real-world applications and utilities
- Example: `Calculator.java` - A simple calculator implementation

## 🎯 How to Use This Structure

1. **For DSA Practice**: Work in `leetcode/` for algorithm problems
2. **For Learning**: Follow tutorials in `tutorials/` for structured learning
3. **For Practice**: Use `practice/` for quick exercises and experimentation
4. **For Projects**: Build complete applications in `projects/`

## 📝 Learning Path Suggestions

1. Start with `tutorials/` for structured learning
2. Practice fundamentals in `practice/basics/`
3. Work on exercises in `practice/exercises/`
4. Solve problems in `leetcode/`
5. Build projects in `projects/`

## 🔧 Getting Started

Each directory contains relevant Java files that can be compiled and run:
```bash
javac YourFile.java
java YourFile
```

Happy coding! 🎉
