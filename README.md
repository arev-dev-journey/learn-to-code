# Learning Journey: SWE, Systems, Cloud, and AI

This repository tracks my progress across languages (Python, Java, C++) and platforms (microservices, containers, Google Cloud, ML/AI).

## Roadmap
- Foundations: DSA in Python, Java, C++
- Systems: Microservices and containers
- Cloud: Google Cloud practitioner path
- AI/ML: Practical business solutions (chatbots, automation)

See `docs/ROADMAP.md` for detailed milestones.

For a portfolio-focused strategy that separates experimental work from polished client-facing projects, review `docs/PORTFOLIO_PLAN.md`.
